Hi there! I decided to make my daily code experiments public. It can be either testing a new famework, a new JavaScript feature or just challenging myself with algorithms.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** ‚ö†Ô∏è

_Code may not always be clean or readable. Some things may not even work!_
_But that's what **experimenting** is all about right ? :)_

# Experiments

### 1 ‚Äì [Re-doing the Just library](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/1-redoing-just)
### 2 ‚Äì [Model Validator](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/2-model-validator)
### 3 ‚Äì [Object Flatten](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/3-object-flatten)
### 4 ‚Äì [Flat Object Class](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/4-flat-object)

# Ideas üí°

### Implement snapshot testing for pure functions

**Question I want to solve:**
Can Jest snapshot testing be applied to pure functions ? Can it speed up our tests ?

**Goals:**
Play around with Jest and pure functions

### Create a small tool to benchmark multiple functions together and analyze their performance

**Question I want to solve:**
I have two implementations of the same algorithm. How can I know which one is faster ? Also, how can I easily benchmark 1000 iterations of these two algorithms ?

**Goals:**
Improve node.js + benchmarking + tests skills

### Experiment something with Proxies and Generators

### Implement something with Web Workers

**Question I want to solve:**
How do Web Workers fit in a real-world app ? What problems can they solve ?

**Goals:**
Use and understand the Web Worker API. Also, benchmark performance with and without WWs.
