Hi there! I decided to make my daily code experiments public. It can be either testing a new famework, a new JavaScript feature or just challenging myself with algorithms.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** ⚠️

_Code may not always be clean or readable. Some things may not even work!_
_But that's what **experimenting** is all about right ? :)_

# Experiments

1 – [Re-doing the Just library](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/redoing-just)
2 – [Model Validator](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/model-validator)
