Hi there! I decided to make my daily code experiments public. It can be either testing a new famework, a new JavaScript feature or just challenging myself with algorithms.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** ‚ö†Ô∏è

_Code may not always be clean or readable. Some things may not even work!_
_But that's what **experimenting** is all about right ? :)_

# Experiments

### 1 ‚Äì [Re-doing the Just library](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/redoing-just)
### 2 ‚Äì [Model Validator](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/model-validator)
### 3 ‚Äì [Object Flatten](https://github.com/dcamilleri/experiments/tree/master/object-flatten)

# Ideas üí°

- Create a small tool to benchmark multiple functions together and analyze their performance

**Question I want to solve:**
I have two implementations of the same algorithm. How can I know which one is faster ? Also, how can I easily benchmark 1000 iterations of these two algorithms ?

**Goals:**
Improve node.js + benchmarking + tests skills

- Experiment something with Proxies and Generators

- Create a small immutability library (Maps and Lists)

**Question I want to solve:**
How hard is it to create an Immutable object or array with JavaScript ? Are there different approaches ?

**Goals:**
Make different versions of an immutable library. I can use Object Proxies, but maybe this is also possible using ES5.

- Implement something with Web Workers

**Question I want to solve:**
How do Web Workers fit in a real-world app ? What problems can they solve ?

**Goals:**
Use and understand the Web Worker API. Also, benchmark performance with and without WWs.
