# 1 - Re-doing Just

Recently, I stumbled across the [Just](https://github.com/angus-c/just) library, an amazing and small JavaScript utility library.

## The experiment

The **challenge** I'm giving myself here is to implement some of the Just utilities, without looking at the original source code. The goal here is to improve my capacity to write efficient **algorithms**.

⚠️ I'm not willing to do `Just` better that it already is. I'm doing it my own way. ⚠️
